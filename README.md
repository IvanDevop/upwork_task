This is a simple set of tasks where you will have to deploy 3 sets of resources on GCP Using terraform. This task is just to ascertain your  workflow and thought process. You are not expected to solve the task with 100% accuracy; rather, you are being assessed on your ability to identify the task requirements and your ability to formulate a process to aid you solve the tasks at hand. 

Using Terraform: (You may use public modules or create your own (take into account the time constraints we have during this interview)

All resources should have the name upwork_task or prefixed with upwork_task_xxx. Example: upwork_task_vpc, upwork_task_gke, etc â€¦ 
Create/deploy vpc on GCP.
Create/deploy a PostreSQL database with 3 users; sa, test, and upwork. Passwords for all 3 accounts can be randomly generated. 
Create a service account with the name upwork_task_sa and assign it the owner and admin roles. 

We would like to see how you work through the tasks and how you identify the prerequisite to achieve your tasks. This is not a must but it will be a plus to see how you formulate the syntax to pass multiple variables at once (iterate through multiple values) for example database users and how you can prefix the name prefix upwork_task  to all your resources.
